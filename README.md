## **vimrc**
There is a sizeable change to vim keybinds when using colemak.  These changes can be seen on the picture below.  Justification for wierd changes are below.  This vimrc is a slightly edited version of both:

- Keys h,n,e and i are used for movement.  N and E are swapped for my terrible gaming/tetris muscle memory, but join and help are in the same place.

- Window movemeen

- l is swapped to append.  I like append more as I find myself at the end of a word or line more often than not, thus i use append as the way to switch into insert mode.

## **i3/regolith**
i3/regolith dotfiles are mostly normal for now. The changes made are localized to window spawning for the time being.

### **Changes Include:**
- Changed how windows spawn to each monitor for my 3 monitor setup.
- Changed where numbered workspaces spawn to ease my hatred of changing where things are and how to get there.

- Xresources changed to override the gap spacing and what names of workspaces are. Also overrided gnome settings from the theme midnight. I hated when i3 would randomly change themes on reload.

## **Alacritty**
Modified gotham theme for better readability. Why do people hate reading terminals? Half the regular theme is unreadable.
