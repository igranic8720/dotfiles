# dotfiles
<h2>Keyboard Layout</h2>
Colemak Layout cuz i hate myself but love my fingers.

<h2>vimrc</h2>
Keys h,n,e and i are used for movement. N and E are swapped for my terrible gaming/tetris muscle memory, but join and help are in the same place.

l is swapped to append. I like append more as I find myself at the end of a word or line more often than not, thus i use append as the way to switch into insert mode.

<h2>i3/regolith</h2>

i3/regolith dotfiles are mostly normal for now.

Changes Include:
    Changed how windows spawn to each monitor for my 3 monitor setup.Changed where numbered workspaces spawn to ease my hatred of changing where things are and how to get there.

    Xresources changed to override the gap spacing and what names of workspaces are. Also overrided gnome settings from the theme midnight. I hated when i3 would randomly change themes on reload.

<h2>Alacritty</h2>
Modified gotham theme for better readability. Why do people hate reading terminals? Half the regular theme is unreadable.
